After introducing the main features characterizing an elementary contractile unit in
cells, I will recall theoretical results concerning motor collections obtained over the
years. In particular I will show how a symmetry breaking transition, emergent feature of a
large number of molecular motor collection, underpins a wide number of biological
functions from muscle oscillations to sound detection. I will then show how a simple
modification of the theoretical framework allows to understand all experimental
observations including force build-up followed by a relaxation and the existence of half
integer steps in the contraction/relaxation curve, which is a resurgence of a nanoscopic
scale in a mesoscopic system.
