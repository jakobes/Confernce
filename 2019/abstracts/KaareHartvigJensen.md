# Controlling intercellular flow through mechanosensitive plasmodesmata nanopores

## Abstract

In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) are nanopores that serve as channels for molecular
cell-to-cell transport. Precise control of PD permeability is essential to regulate phloem
loading and unloading; moreover it is involved in growth, tissue patterning, and defense
against pathogens. Callose deposition modulates PD transport but little is known of the
rapid events that lead to PD closure in response to tissue damage or osmotic shock. We
propose a new mechanism of PD closure as a result of mechanosensing. Pressure forces cause
the cell wall, or the dumbbell-shaped ER-desmotubule-complex, to be displaced from the
equilibrium position, thus closing the PD aperture. Cell wall elasticity and the
filamentous protein tethers that link the plasma membrane (PM) to the ER complex play a
key role in determining the selectivity of the PD pore. This model of PD control compares
favorably with experimental data on the pressure-generated closure of PD.
