# Brain Wrinkling

## Abstract

The fascinating convolutions of the human brain are believed to be caused by
mechanical forces generated in the rapid expansion of the cortex with respect to the
subcortical areas of the brain. These intricate folded shapes have fascinated generations
of scientists and have, so far, defied a complete description. How do they emerge? How is
the brain shape related to its function? In this talk, I will review our current
understanding of brain morphogenesis and how it can be modelled as a problem of active
process in soft matter. In particular, I will discuss an ideal version of this problem
given by the wrinkling of a morphoelastic film bounded to an elastic substrate.
