Monolayers of cells in tissue are examples of thin structures that are continuously driven out of
equilibrium by the activity of their constituent elements. One generic property of these active
layers is the spontaneous emergence of collective flows which often leads to chaotic flow patterns
characterised by swirls, jets, and topological defects in their orientation field [1]. In this talk I
will discuss recent works on cell monolayers, where we find interesting correlations between liquid
crystal-like features of these active systems and their biological functionality.
I will explain our recent finding on the role of topological defects in regulating the morphology of
growing cell colonies and represent evidence on spontaneous formation of singularities in cellular
alignment in the form of nematic topological defects, as a previously unidentified cause of cell
apoptosis and extrusion, suggesting that such defects govern cell fate in epithelial tissues [2,3]. In
addition, I will present the emergence of tissue-scale oscillations in epithelial tissues when confined
within micro-domains [4].
