# The effect of breathing on Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow

# Abstract
Current theories suggest that waste solutes are cleared from the brain
via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, driven by pressure pulsations of
possibly both cardiac and respiratory origin. In this talk, I will show
that pressure pulsations in the brain are dominated by cardiac rather
than the respiratory cycle by a factor of three. CSF velocities are
equally affected by the two cycles, while the volume over one cycle is
four times greater for respiration due to the longer period. Finally, I
will discuss possible effects of breathing exercises (e.g. yoga) on CSF
flow.
