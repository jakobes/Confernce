Transmembrane proteins are sorted by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery
into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Vesicle formation starts with a small deformation of the endosome membrane,
which grows in time and leads to the formation of an ILV. We present a minimal mathematical model that
describes ILV formation as a result of the interplay between protein induced Gaussian bending rigidity and
protein crowding. The model reproduces several key experimental findings: (1) An ESCRT-free ILV is formed with
(2) a diameter that is independent of the endosome size and (3) an enhanced ESCRT density in the membrane neck
region. We find that all three observations, are a consequence of an energy minimization, which balances the
loss in binding energy in the ESCRT-free ILV bud by a gain in Gaussian bending energy in the membrane neck
region. Furthermore, we find that a passive ILV formation, which follows a negative energy gradient, is
enabled by a non-homogenous Gaussian bending rigidity, due to the crowding of ESCRT proteins in the membrane
neck. Combining the mathematical model with experimental measurements of ESCRT recruitment dynamics and 
electron microscopy imaging of transient ILV shapes, we discuss the role of so-called early ESCRTs in membrane
shape remodeling, which supports the notion that early ESCRTs cause membrane budding by protein crowing
without ATP consumption.
